NOTE: This project was created WITHOUT the src/ directory.
All source files live at the project root level, not inside /src/.

- Routes live in        /app/[page]/page.tsx
- Root layout at        /app/layout.tsx
- Root styles at        /app/globals.css
- Shared components at  /components/ui/          (buttons, cards, badges etc.)
- Section components at /components/sections/    (hero, navbar, footer etc.)
- 3D components at      /components/three/       (WebGL / particle effects)
- Animation wrappers at /components/ui/          (RevealWrapper, CountUp etc.)
- Page-specific files at /app/[page]/_components/
- Design tokens at      /lib/tokens.ts
- Utility functions at  /lib/utils.ts
- Static assets at      /public/assets/

## CODE STYLE — ALWAYS DO
- Use TypeScript strict mode. Always type props and return values.
- Use Tailwind utility classes. Never write custom CSS unless unavoidable.
- Use design tokens from DESIGN.md for all colours, fonts, and spacing.
- Keep components small and focused. One responsibility per component.
- Use semantic HTML elements (section, article, nav, header, footer, main).
- All images must have descriptive alt text.
- All forms must have proper labels and ARIA attributes.
- Animations must respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Mobile-first. Write the mobile layout first, then add md: and lg: breakpoints.
- Commit small and often. One logical change per commit.

## CODE STYLE — NEVER DO
- Never hardcode colours, font names, or spacing values.
- Never use <div> if a semantic HTML element exists.
- Never write inline styles (style={{ }}) unless Framer Motion requires it.
- Never install a new npm package without asking first.
- Never modify /public/assets files — only reference them.
- Never delete or rename existing files without asking.
- Never use any, unknown, or type assertions unless absolutely necessary.
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or .env values.
- Never use lorem ipsum — if content is missing, use [PLACEHOLDER: description].

## SAFETY & PERMISSIONS
WITHOUT ASKING — allowed to:
- Read any file in the project
- Create new components in /components/ui/ and /components/sections/
- Create new page files in /app/
- Edit /app/globals.css and tailwind.config.ts
- Run: tsc, eslint, prettier, npm run dev

ASK FIRST — must confirm before:
- Installing any npm package
- Deleting any file
- Modifying package.json or next.config.ts
- Running npm run build or git push
- Making any change to .env or .env.local

## SESSION PROTOCOL
1. Start: Read AGENTS.md (this file), SPEC.md, DESIGN.md, and PROGRESS.md.
2. State what phase you are in and what tasks you will complete this session.
3. Work through tasks one at a time. After each task, confirm completion.
4. If you encounter an ambiguity or missing info, stop and ask — do not guess.
5. End: Update PROGRESS.md with: what was completed, any issues found,
   what the next session should start with.

## COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT
feat: [what was added]
fix: [what was fixed]
style: [visual/styling changes]
content: [copy/text changes]
chore: [config, deps, tooling]

Example: feat: add hero section with animated gradient background
